rnabob - fast RNA motif searching
Copyright (C) 1992-1996 Sean R. Eddy
---------------------------------------

The program "rnabob" searches for RNA motifs in sequence databases.
Rather than searching simply for primary sequence matches, rnabob
allows one to search for secondary and tertiary structural motifs as
well.

The underlying algorithm is a non-deterministic finite state machine
very similar to that used by UNIX regular expression pattern matching
algorithms, but with the modification that downstream nodes may be
constructed dynamically based on matches at upstream nodes (thus, the
ability to search for complementarity or other absolute covariances).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
-----------------
Much of the underlying implementation was borrowed from Henry
Spencer's "regexp" package. Thanks, Henry. However, I modified it
heavily -- any bugs and mistakes are mine.

Sequence i/o functions are originally from Don Gilbert's famous
"readseq" library. Thanks, Don. Again, I've modified readseq heavily,
and any mistakes are mine.
