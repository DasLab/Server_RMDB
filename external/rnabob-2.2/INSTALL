rnabob -- Installation instructions
------------------------------------

1. Edit the top of the Makefile. Change the install paths to reflect where
   you want things installed; modify the CFLAGS as necessary to make your 
   compiler happy. ["make" should work fine to build rnabob without
   editing anything, but if you want "make install" to work automatically,
   you'll want to edit the Makefile.]

   The default configuration assumes you have the GNU C compiler gcc
   properly installed. You will need to change CC to "cc" from "gcc"
   if you prefer your vendor's compiler to the GNU compiler.

2. Type "make". 

3. If everything built cleanly, type "make install".

rnabob has been built and tested on a number of different UNIX platforms
and OS's, including:
    SGI Indigo2 R4400, IRIX 5.3 (wol.wustl.edu)
    Sun Ultra-1, Solaris 2.5    (wilkins.wustl.edu)
    DEC Alpha, OSF/1 V3.2       (sable.wustl.edu)
    Intel Pentium, Linux 1.2.13 (wombat.wustl.edu)

I "guarantee" portability to any UNIX platform, meaning that if it
doesn't build cleanly for you right out of the box, it's a bug. Please
report any portability difficulties to me (eddy@genetics.wustl.edu).
