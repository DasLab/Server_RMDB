 * parametrization given here:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_curve#Cubic_B.C3.A9zier_curves
 * You can then use the constant speed parametrization over this sequence

	 * argument. The use of a sorted array instead of m calls to the

	 * because we don't need to search in all the n possible lines for
	 * each value in t (as we know their are in increasing order).
