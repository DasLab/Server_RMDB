						Data Archive Usage
					</h3>
					<p class="cap">
						Data entries contained in the RMDB archive are under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">public domain&nbsp;<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window" aria-hidden="true"></span></a> (free of all copyright restrictions) and are fully available for both non-commercial and commercial use. Users of the data should attribute the original authors listed on the data entry. By using the data in the RMDB archive, the user agrees to abide by the following conditions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>The archival data files in the RMDB archive are made freely available to all users. Data files within the archive may be redistributed in original form without restriction. Redistribution of modified data files using the same file name as is in the RMDB database server is prohibited.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Data files containing RMDB content may include the RMDB ID entry name (e.g. MDLOOP_STD_0000) only if they are exactly the same as what is residing in the RMDB archive. This does not prevent databases from including RMDB IDs as cross-references where it is clear that they refer to the RMDB archive. The distribution of modified RMDB data in RDAT format and equivalents is not allowed.</p>

							<p>The user assumes all responsibility for insuring that intellectual property claims associated with any data set deposited in the RMDB archive are honored. It should be understood that the RMDB data files do not contain any information on intellectual property claims.</p>
